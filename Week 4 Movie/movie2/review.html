      <h2>REVIEW</h2>

      <p><b>David Kong</b> <i>October 2025</i></p>

      <p><em>Step Brothers</em> holds up on a second watch. Even outside a packed theater, it still lands as a completely ridiculous, proudly stupid comedy — and that’s the point. Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly bounce off each other perfectly, stacking one absurd bit on top of another until it becomes impossible not to laugh.</p>

      <p>Yes, it’s juvenile and over the top, but the commitment sells it. The timing, the chemistry, and the escalating set pieces make the movie feel electric. Line after line keeps catching you off guard, and the momentum rarely dips.</p>

      <p>Beneath the chaos there’s a surprisingly sincere streak about friendship, family, and growing up (kind of). It’s one of my personal favorites and still sits alongside the modern comedy greats.</p>
